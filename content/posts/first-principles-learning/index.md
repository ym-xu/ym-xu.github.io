Most learning advice is tactical—apps, tips, and hacks. First principles help you reason from the ground up and adapt across domains. This post condenses research-backed principles into an actionable workflow you can use today.

## Why first principles?

- Generalizable across skills (programming, writing, languages).
- Composable—you can mix and match without brittle routines.
- Resilient to tool churn; principles outlast platforms.

## 1) Define the smallest useful outcome (SUO)

Pick a concrete, valuable outcome you can achieve in days, not weeks. Examples:
- Implement a REST handler with proper error boundaries.
- Summarize a paper in 8 sentences and 2 diagrams.
- Hold a 5-minute conversation about your project in English.

Constraints sharpen attention and feedback loops.

## 2) Retrieval beats rereading

Testing yourself reconstructs knowledge and reveals gaps.
- Use active prompts: “Explain X to a teammate without notes.”
- Close-book recalls > open-book rereads for durable memory.
- Track friction—if recall stalls, that’s where to practice.

## 3) Space and interleave practice

- Spaced repetition: revisit just before forgetting to maximize gain/effort.
- Interleaving: mix problem types so you learn to discriminate, not just repeat.
- Keep sessions short (25–45 min), end on a small success.

## 4) Generate, don’t transcribe

Transform inputs into your own words and structures:
- Write a one-paragraph distillation per source.
- Sketch diagrams; reshape equations into intuition.
- Create a tiny project that uses the idea once.

## 5) Teach to learn

If you can teach it, you understand it. Options:
- Write a post (like this) or a short note.
- Record a 3-minute loom for a teammate.
- Pair-program and narrate decisions.

## A minimal workflow

1) Choose an SUO and deadline (e.g., 3 days).
2) Daily loop: retrieve → practice → generate → reflect (15 min journal).
3) Publish a small artifact (gist, note, demo) and collect feedback.

## Toolkit (optional)

- Notes: plain Markdown + folders; keep friction low.
- Spacing: calendar reminders or any SRS you already use.
- Feedback: share WIP early with a peer or community.
